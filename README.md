## Welcome to my website! 

My name is Garrett Garberich and I am currently a senior at the George Washington University double majoring in Political Science and Journalism/Mass Communications. I am originally from Orange County, California but most of my family has recently relocated to Texas.

### Flexboard for Transition Data 
This flexboard highlights different aspects of the transition data. The first page highlights those agencies with the largest changes and those agencies with no changes whatsoever. The second page shows the largest departments while the third page shows the agencies with the smallest amount of workers. 

To view my flexboard with important transition data click [here](https://ggarberich.github.io/FlexBoard%20for%20Transition%20Data%20/#department-changes).
